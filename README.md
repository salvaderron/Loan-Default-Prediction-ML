## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning solution for loan default prediction using the LendingClub dataset. The system combines traditional supervised deep learning with reinforcement learning principles to create an intelligent loan approval system that maximizes financial returns while effectively managing risk.

**Key Achievements:**
- ðŸš€ **78% AUC Score** - Excellent discriminative capability
- ðŸ“ˆ **45% F1-Score** for defaulters - Significant improvement from baseline
- ðŸ’° **68% Overall Accuracy** - Industry-competitive performance
- ðŸ”§ **Memory-Optimized** - Handles datasets with 2M+ records efficiently
- ðŸ§  **Hybrid Decision System** - Combines risk assessment with profit optimization
